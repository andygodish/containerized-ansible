# Containerized Ansible

Rather than maintaining dependencies in your local environment, use this purpose-built Ansible container that:

Can be run with a single command
Mounts local playbooks/inventory for execution
Provides a consistent environment for Ansible operations

## Necessary System Packages

```
# Dockerfile 

RUN apk add --no-cache openssh-client bash
```



### Implementation Questions

Generated from early converations with the team (ie, AI)

1. Do you want to include any Ansible collections by default, or just the core?
2. How do you plan to handle SSH authentication? (Mounting keys, agent forwarding)
3. Will you need to support Ansible Vault operations?
4. Any specific version requirements for Ansible?
5. Any specific plugins or dependencies your playbooks typically require?
